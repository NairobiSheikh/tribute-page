            <p id="facts"> 30 fun facts about Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Naruto was bron in Japan on the night of October 10th.</li>
                <li>Parents: Minato Namikaza and Kushina Uzumaki.</li>
                <li>He was named affer Naruto Musasabi the protagoist of Jiraiya sensei first book aka Naruto's ninja mastor.</li>
                <li>There is this mystical beast called the Nine-tails, Which comes from his mother. Before they were able to safely seal the Nine-tails in Norito his mom and dad get attacked by the villain aka Tobi, where then Tobi releases the Nine-tails from Kushina, Naruto's mother into the wild and brings destruction to Naruto's home town, and in that chaos the Nine-tails kill his father and his mother.</li>
                <li>That night Naruto became in orphan with a mystical beast called the Nine-tails.</li>
                <li>Orphaned, not having parents or anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in order to afford daily necessities. Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.</li>
                <li>Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did. However, Naruto's peers emulated their parents' hatred of him, despite not knowing why. This social isolation caused Naruto to crave acknowledgement, which he would gain by pulling pranks.</li>
                <li>He persevered through all that hate and year after year he won over the town's heart.</li>
                <li>In the Academy, Naruto became a student of Iruka Umino, who acted as a surrogate older brother to keep him in line and help him work harder. Naruto also met his class-mate Sasuke Uchiha and tried to befriend him, since he was alone as well. Jealous of Sasuke's skills and popularity, however, he developed a one-sided rivalry in his pursuit to prove himself just as good as, if not better than, Sasuke, wishing that someday, Sasuke would accept him as an equal. Naruto also grew close with the owner of Ramen Ichiraku, Teuchi and his daughter Ayame, being welcomed as their favourite customer.</li>
                <li>Naruto is noted as boisterous, exuberant and unorthodox, quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when emotional.</li>
                <li>Naruto is relatively naïve and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations and can even prove forgetful. Naruto is aware of his faults, and admits he acts strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.</li>
                <li>Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social isolation has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: he is heedless to formality and social standings, addressing certain people with nicknames instead of honourifics, although by the time of his adulthood, Naruto has slightly outgrown this trait.</li>
                <li>He has a perverted side that manifests as uses of the Sexy Technique or attempts to peep into women's baths. Despite his quirks and the criticism they earn him, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him, inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world view and thus built meaningful relationships that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six Paths believes Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred.</li>
                <li>Another of Naruto's prominent traits is his desire for acknowledgement; his pranks around the village were for people to notice him, even if it meant by scolding him. Therefore, he dreamed of one day becoming Konoha's Hokage, the epitome of acknowledgement and respect from everyone in the village. Knowing his dream is a long, arduous and seemingly impossible path, Naruto developed his own nindō of never going back on his word. This life-long philosophy serves as the cornerstone of Naruto's great self-confidence; he believes he can accomplish any goal with enough hard work and perseverance, no matter what.</li>
                <li>No develops a crush of one of his teammates Sakura but Brado dont love him back.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile Hinata another broad who is way more attractive than Sakura is in love with her man Norito!</li>
                <li>Norito failed his genin test and did not pass to become a Shinobi.</li>
                <li>Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from the Academy three times. Through sheer determination and training however, his skills rapidly improved to defeat strong genin like Neji Hyūga, Gaara, and Kabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all the Sannin for his potential.</li>
                <li>Naruto wore an orange and blue jacket with a white collar, a white swirl with a tassel on the left side, and a red Uzumaki crest on the back. He also wore orange pants with a shuriken holster on his right knee, blue sandals, and a blue forehead protector, given to him by Iruka after graduating from the Academy.</li>
                <li>Naruto loses his right arm after the Fourth Shinobi World War, though it is later replaced by a fully maneouverable prosthetic arm made of Hashirama Senju's cells, wrapped completely in bandages.</li>
                <li>Naruto first met Hinata Hyūga when they were children, where his open kindness and courageous spirit earned him her admiration, which grew into love. On his part, Naruto remained mostly oblivious to Hinata's feelings for him and even considered her "weird" because of her shyness around him. However, that change during the Chūnin Exams in Part I when they began to interact more and support each other, causing Naruto to like her as a friend. In Part II, as Hinata becomes willing to risk her life to protect Naruto, he, in turn, sees her as an actively strong person despite his speechlessness at her love confession. Naruto did grow to love Hinata subconsciously. Still, he was aware of it because he kept "fighting" for Sakura, which was just another way for him to compete with Sasuke.</li>
                <li>Hinata and Naruto get married shortly after that.</li>
                <li>They have two kids; Himawari Uzumaki(Daughter) && Boruto Uzumaki(son).</li>
                <li>He becoms the Hokage at the age of 30- 32.</li>
                <li>Sasuke Uchiha Is his rival, brother from another monthr and best friend.</li>
                <li>Jiraiya reflects on his failures: his failure to win the heart of Tsunade; his failure to redeem Orochimaru; his failure to protect Minato or the Third Hokage; and now his failure to have a meaningful death. His thoughts turn to Naruto, who Jiraiya knows wouldn't submit to failure like this and would keep fighting for as long as he could. Jiraiya decides that he, as Naruto's teacher, should demonstrate the same resolve. As such, he forces himself back to consciousness and uses the last of his energy to etch a coded message into Fukasaku's back.And with that JIRAIYA is dad and was the godfather of Norito.</li>
                <li>After all that hate and ostracizing and isolating Norito he finally got the love and respect from his village.</li>
                <li>As an adult, Naruto becomes wiser and more mature, though he retains some of his negligence for honourifics. Although he finally achieves his dream of becoming Hokage</li>
                <li>A man's favorite food is Ramen!!!</li>
